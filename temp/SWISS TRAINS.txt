Im going to keep trying to go UP to see just how rugged this system gets.

JH ADD THINKIUNG


* One line about Gotthard connecting the two fascist regimes during WWII
   * 👉 Militarily, no — Switzerland never allowed Axis troops or weapons through the Gotthard.
   * 👉 Economically, yes — Switzerland allowed trade traffic, including Axis goods, through its tunnels and railways, under the logic of “neutral commerce.”
	



Music Thinking


1. FEELING: TF build a demo called ‘swiss trains-city repetitions’ this chord progression is it. This is our theme. Lets lean in and express this tone in a lot of different instruments and tempos. 
2. Pensive, deep moment. This demo works great.   
3. Magic ethereal tone. Lets do way more of this   
4. High energy challenge music. Like ‘swiss boarding time’. Can you do a few more variation of this vibe with a slightly less vibey lead. Its a sick lead it just takes up a lot of space in the mix. I think we can use it for a section but i wanna have a few more high energy beats. 
   1. Style wise can you tone down the 80s tech energy on the arps its sounds just a little too “IBM” which you know I love but not for this one. 
   2. Having a track break from a beat and go into a softer non rhythmic section with the same main idea is also super useful to keep the high energy sections dynamic. 


   5. STRING ENERGY: For high energy challenge scenes lets lean into a few more string vibes like this. Its imbued with some serious curiosity but playful hope. I love this balance.. Just please build out some longer underster score scene with simple evolution before some of those busier sections come in.   
      1. I really love the fusion of strings and beats in this one
  

	


ADDITIONAL SOTS


1.Nick Guide
---------
This one could be a good add to somewhere in the 19:04 sequence. It could also be cut down to "It's a miracle, a technical miracle". We want to show a little more hype from Nick.
03 NICK GUIDE: [00:07:11] It's an miracle, a technical miracle. Because this composition has eight engines and there the synchronization of these engines is the most big problem that's running so smooth [00:07:25][14.0]
-------------
This one would be to add more to the story of the glacier scene, it could go after the line "now it's about 500 metres higher" and before the line "maybe in 100 years the alps won't have any glacier any more"
03 NICK GUIDE: [00:11:03] But there is the way down to go to the glacier and the people could walk on the glacier. That's how they made the first money. [00:11:13][10.7]


Round 2 of SOT suggestions
These are for the canton challenge just to introduce more heart and soul and train love
--------
Speaker 2: [00:19:27] And I thought it was so funny that everyone is like, yeah, of course we're better because we have the best trains, but rarely ever do Swiss people, I feel like, reflect on. What goes into, like how much training does Simone Biles need to do to be Simone Bile's and how much work goes into Swiss trains, to make Swiss trains Swiss trains? [00:19:47][20.0]
-------
This SOT is way to long but brings some good comedic energy about Swiss Train superiority

Speaker 5: [00:53:14] Is that German trains are always too late and most people don't like German trains. They are too late, they are always on strike because they don't pay their workers enough and so on and so forth. And the consequence of that is that in Switzerland, we don't let in German trains because they are too later and they will just fuck up our timetables. And in Basel, we have trains that are ready to jump in for the case that a German train is too late. [00:53:43][29.2]
------
Another SOT you could add to the one above about German trains sucking

Speaker 8: [01:45:27] why so many trains are delayed from Germany and Swiss people don't like that it's kind of like a whole meme because everything from Germany is delayed, is that there is a lot of padding here in the timetable. So even if a train is delayed it's very easy to catch it up. [01:45:41][14.3]
-----
Speaker 8: [01:07:12] I think the train system is something that is bringing a very high value in the Swiss society and that's equality. At least getting the chance or equal chances gives you the opportunity to live in the landscape and still commute to the city by not having a car. [01:07:33][21.0]

	In Grindelwald I met up with Nick who grew up around here and is going to show me just how extreme this infrastructure can get. 
	16:14
	We’re getting ready to board a train. NIck is showing me these majestic mountains. The ones those british tourists came all the way to see. 



Reinforcing this concept that blows my american mind a little bit about access to transportation as a RIGHT
	16:29
	Here comes our train that will take me on the next leg of this journey 
	17:06
	We immediately enter a tunnel. And unlike the other tunnels I've traveled on today, im not moving flat. 
	18:37
	Nick translated the scene for me, naming the peaks, and telling me the story of this glacier. How it used to be TK bigger. How it probably won’t exist in a few decades. 
	18:56
	But just as i was enthralled with the silent  glimpsing the mountains from inside the mountains, i heard the clank of metal on metal echoing up this  idealistic tunnel 
	20:28
	And here comes the end of my challenge

to see what how much remote, how rugged, now low to high high I could move in a day using the public transportation system. 
----  
And I’d say we did pretty good. ...


	20:59
	This whole day I’ve been asking myself why? What drove these people to do this without any guarentee it would be worth it. 

But then being up here, seeing europes largest glacier, and an auspicious fly by from teh swiss airforce,...[JH whoaaa]  

it all kind of came together. 

These tunnels, gondolas, and and railines arent just government projects or business ventures. 

They are physical symbols of one of the founding myths of modern switzerland. Their story of engineering unity and connection despite all the many divisions and differences. This is their taj mahal, their Golden Gate Bridge, their Great Wall of China
	21:48
	Its time to descend and turn my mind to the next challenge,

I want to step foot in all 26 swiss regions ,or cantons in one day. Only using public transportation 



As we descend I can’t help but show Nick my maps to test if he’s as into them as I am. 

He doesn’t seem that interested…

That is until I open them up 
	22:34
	I head back down into the valley and off into the system 

to the other side of the country. snaking under the alps again into the french speaking valley where I will begin the challenge bright and early tomorrow. 

I’m going over the route one more time. Confirming with the locas who are going to meet up with me as I try to do this. 



But the only way Im going to be successful on this journey is if something invisible works tomorrow. 

Something that unlike the tunnels ryan under the surface of every track, station, train, and passager in this system. 


	23:27
	Filling in these TKs
	36:07
	As im traveling back through this tunnel, i start to realize that even though I’ve hit TK cantons, its nearly 5pm and I still have all these canton up here. 


These are more rural and hard to get to. As I go the calculation its not going to work.

 “I'm an American who doesn't really understand trains. I'm embarrassed to say my country is a country that loves cars and individual expression that cars give you. So I'm here to immerse myself in Swiss trains, to ride as many of these trains as I possibly can to live on these trains..and try to understand what they've built, how it works, how it's designed, what are the crazy engineering feats that they've done to make this system work? 




And most importantly, what can we outside of this country learn from it all?

	. Swiss federal leaders stepped up to broker a solution. In 1869–1870, the Federal Council negotiated an international treaty with Italy and the German states to jointly support a Gotthard Railway, selecting the Gotthard route as the primary north–south transalpine linehls-dhs-dss.ch. Federal Councillor Emil Welti and others championed the Gotthard project as a matter of national destiny – it would secure Switzerland’s place on the main European trade artery between Germany and Italy. The Gotthardbahn-Gesellschaft was formed in 1871, with the Swiss Confederation, several cantons, and foreign governments all buying shares and providing subsidies to build the enormous 15 km Gotthard tunnelgeschichtslehrer.ingeschichtslehrer.in. This marked a significant shift: the federal government was now directly intervening in railway development, coordinating funding and assuming some risk, which went beyond the laissez-faire ethos of 1852. The rhetoric around the Gotthard also invoked national unity – the railway would “complete the final joining of the three Swiss cultural regions” (German, French, Italian) and boost the economy of Ticino by properly linking it to the rest of Switzerlandgeschichtslehrer.ingeschichtslehrer.in. The Gotthard line, opened in 1882, indeed became a symbol of Swiss engineering prowess and national pride, fulfilling a long-held vision of Switzerland as the hinge of Europe rather than an isolated mountain enclave.

That tourism industry brought demand for more trains that could go into crazier and crazier places, which allowed them to invest even more into train infrastructure, which brought more tourists, which brought better train infrastructure. [CITATION]

There's this astounding rail trip, this astounding journey.

Do a timelapse of trains all arriving between 10:20 and 10:30 and then all departing between 1030 and 1040
	

	This is happening not just at Zurich but at all these hubs where as the clock approaches the top of the hour, trains comes flooding in on by one, then there’s a brief moment of stillness as the clock passes over the hour and people transfer.. And then all the sudden they start departing in quick succession

MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT RENDER OF THE VIDEO FOR UNDERSTANDING. 
*****DIRECTION HERE
Zoom out and see the wide map
And clock stays with andfsat forwards to , approaching 10:50 and we see tons of dots (trains) on the system and they all start arriving to the hubs between 10:50 and 10:58
Then there’s silence no motion between 10:58 and 11:02 and then
From 11:02-11:10 they are leave their stations again one by one until 11:10 when they are all departed 
	

	This is called the teh Takfarplan, literally the timetable that pulses like a drum or ticks like the gears in a watch, [CITATION]


So starting in the 80s the whole system starts to confom to this pulse system  
	Nation Pulse.mov
Can you loop this so we can see the “arrival, pause, depart” pulse over and over and over 
	

	 
	

	

	Like the route from bern to zurich or bern to basel were just over and hour, which means trains between these hubs woudlnt arrive before the hour to make the pulse.  
	Nation Pulse.mov
Isolate the route between bern and zurich and bern and basel

Inspo like this   
  

	

	So in 2004 they focused just on making this part faster [CITATION]
	  

	

	Not high-speed bullet trains. But just fast enough to make these trips just under an hour [Zürich–Bern from 69 → 56 min, Basel–Bern 67 → 55] so it can slip into the pulse. [CITATION[ar]]
	  

	

	This is how they decide what improvements to make the to the system. What will make this thing pulse 
	

	

	All the regional trains and local buses are also timed to arrive right before the pulse. 
 
And the result is super easy to remember timetables, and the insane reality that  77% of train trips you never have to wait more than 10 minutes for a transfer [CITATION[as]],

[k]When French troops moved in to Switzerland in 1798, the 13 old cantons and cities ruled or had alliances with other parts of the country. Due to Napoleon’s intervention, the once powerful cantons had to give up their sovereignty in favour of a central government.


This led to fighting between advocates of federalism and supporters of the ruling central state. In 1803, Napoleon invited deputies from the quarreling Swiss parties to Paris, where he came up with a compromise: the Act of Mediation, which made all cantons equal, with their own constitutions. It was the birth of modern federalism.

[m]Switzerland has practiced neutrality since the sixteenth century,
interrupted only during the Napoleonic wars between 1798 and
1815. The growth of Swiss neutrality can be attributed mainly to two factors, one external and one internal. Switzerland's geographic situation, buffered between mightier states often at war with each other, was the first. Since European transit ways passed through Switzerland's borders, its territory was of strategic importance.


Neighboring states would not have tolerated an antagonistic power's dominance of Switzerland, but they accepted Swiss neutrality provided that Switzerland defended each state against any attempt at foreign domination. Neutrality, for Switzerland, was thus a condition of its independence, while for the European states it was a stabilizing element in the European balance of power.

[o]The end of French rule was formalised during the Vienna Congress of 1815, following Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo.


In Switzerland – as elsewhere in Europe – the Congress served to restore the old patrician privileges and the Swiss returned to a system of sovereign states.

[q]This segment could use a bit more nuance. Do with these inputs what you will! 


Found this article in english that are super interesting and include video: https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/history/napoleon-bonaparte-s-impact-on-switzerland/46596446


Gist of the timeline is this: 


>>> French revolution inspires swiss to make their own revolution they abolish the (mostly absolutist and aristocratic confederation).


>>> Helvetic Republic is founded. Out of fear that ousted Aristocrats might reclaim power, the new republic is super centralized and (over-)emphasizes the power of the state massively (Possible framing: it essentially overcompensated for the divided confederation by going "full central state") 


>>> New system causes unrest and instability.


>>> Cue Napoleon, he lobbies for a "federal state", ergo a centralized state but with a vertical division of power, meaning the cantons and counties retain jurisdictional power in certain areas. He "mediates" this solution among the infighting swiss so we call this period in swiss history "Mediation". 


>>> After kicking out the french after napoleon's defeat the swiss essentially kept this system and opted for armed neutrality. 


>>> the congress of vienna essentially nods off current status quo and makes them "international law",


Finally, but that's just my (possibly biased) opinion: 


I'd avoid overemphasizing the big powers "just invade and divide them up amongst ourselvess" as a serious option since it wasn't that much of an option to begin. On one hand they knew it would be a very gruesome campaign. The swiss were still very famous for their prowess in battle, (swiss guards were very popular amongst the monarchs of europe) you just don't fight them on their hometurf and expect it to be a cake-walk.


On the other hand, the only power that could have seriously considered invading switzerland was Austria, Prussia was too far away and France just got kicked out by the swiss prior to the congress.

[t]The Sonderbund, led politically by Konstantin Siegwart-Müller of Luzern, took up arms in November 1847 and appealed for help from abroad, but neither its military organization, commanded by Johann Ulrich von Salis-Soglio, nor its appeal were satisfactorily effective. The peace settlement of 1848 required the former members of the Sonderbund to pay 6,000,000 francs for the cost of the war and charged the cantons of Appenzell Inner-Rhoden and Neuchâtel 15,000 and 300,000 francs, respectively, as fines for having been neutral; a new constitution for Switzerland also was adopted. In 1852 the unpaid balance of the war costs was written off.

[w]It was not until 1844, with the opening of the French line from Strasbourg to the Swiss border in Basel, that the country first came into contact with actual railways. This did not however spark any sudden construction frenzy at the time. Not until a further three years later (1847) was the first railway line inaugurated on exclusively Swiss soil: the Northern Railway line from Zurich to Baden – better known as the ‘Spanisch-Brötli-Bahn’, named after a Spanish pastry popular in the region at the time. A beacon of hope, certainly, but the northern railway remained the only railway line in the country for years to come.

[y]It took another five years before the Federal Railway Act of 1852 set off a railway building boom. Suddenly railway companies shot up all over the country. The Federal Act on the Construction and Operation of Railways on the Territory of the Swiss Confederation (1852) enabled private companies to build railway lines and stations and operate them. The cantons were responsible for issuing the licences, as the federal government's scope for intervention at the time was limited to matters of national defence.

[ab]Domestic challenges rather than foreign ones were typical during this period. Economic development caused a malaise among different social groups; for example, laborers suffered from difficult working conditions, and the precapitalist elites, rural masses, and urban craftsmen all were losing their traditional sources of income.


https://www.britannica.com/place/Switzerland/Switzerland-from-1848-to-the-present
[ac]two major railway companies and 16 cantons joined forces on 7 August 1863 to form the ‘Gotthard Railway Association’.


https://www.aboutswitzerland.eda.admin.ch/en/a-nation-of-railway-enthusiasts-a-history-of-the-swiss-railways
[ad]Because of the influence of the “railway barons,” the most prominent of whom was Alfred Escher from Zürich, the railways were built through competition between private entrepreneurs rather than in accordance with some central plan. The result was an extensive network of small and medium-sized lines that were barely coordinated but covered more than 600 miles (1,000 km) of track by 1860 and twice that amount by 1876.


To compete with the opening of the trans-Alpine Mount Cenis and Brenner Pass rail links, the Swiss negotiated construction of the St. Gotthard Tunnel with Italian and German interests. After 10 years of excavation, marked by labor unrest and the death of some 167 workers, the 9.3-mile (15-km) tunnel—then the world’s longest—opened in 1882. Thus, the cantons of Uri and Ticino were connected by rail, and a direct line was inaugurated between Zürich and Milan. 


To finance railway construction, Escher in 1856 founded one of Switzerland’s largest and most successful banks, the Kreditanstalt (now Credit Suisse).

[af]Throughout the country, new railway connections and stations were now built wherever it made economic sense. Thanks to the railways, the distribution of goods became much more efficient and therefore cheaper. Traffic hubs such as those in Zurich and Winterthur emerged. Even smaller towns such as Olten saw an undreamt-of gain in importance thanks to the railways. The rail network came to mark the divide between the nation's economic and social heartland and the periphery. And by 1860, just eight years after Parliament's landmark decision, Switzerland was already the country with the densest rail network in Europe.


Meanwhile, much discussion was going on over the planned route to link northern and southern Switzerland by rail: abroad, construction of the first Alpine railways was forging ahead at Semmering and through the Mont-Cenis Pass, but in Switzerland people were still arguing over which route to settle on. After all, in addition to the Gotthard, the Lukmanier, Simplon and Great St Bernard passes were also possible contenders for a transalpine route. The danger of Switzerland being bypassed altogether grew steadily from the mid-19th century, and so the Alpine transit question became ever more urgent.

[ah]His efforts bore fruit: of the total estimated construction costs of CHF 187 million for the Gotthard Railway, an international consortium covered the greater part (CHF 102 million). In addition to these funds raised on the capital markets, substantial commitments were made by the two major Swiss railway companies – the Swiss North-Eastern Railway Company and the Swiss Central Railway – and state subsidies were provided by Germany and Italy. Swiss cantons and communes also lent financial support. The federal government initially did not participate.


Thanks to cash injections from Italy (10 million), Germany (10 million), and the first modest subsidy from the federal government (4.5 million), as well as private investment, the Gotthard Railway could finally be completed.

Moreover, construction engineering was still in its early days, and the Gotthard granite posed a particular challenge. Never before had such a construction project been undertaken in the Alps,

Even smaller towns such as Olten saw an undreamt-of gain in importance thanks to the railways. The rail network came to mark the divide between the nation's economic and social heartland and the periphery. And by 1860, just eight years after Parliament's landmark decision, Switzerland was already the country with the densest rail network in Europe.


Meanwhile, much discussion was going on over the planned route to link northern and southern Switzerland by rail: abroad, construction of the first Alpine railways was forging ahead at Semmering and through the Mont-Cenis Pass, but in Switzerland people were still arguing over which route to settle on. After all, in addition to the Gotthard, the Lukmanier, Simplon and Great St Bernard passes were also possible contenders for a transalpine route. The danger of Switzerland being bypassed altogether grew steadily from the mid-19th century, and so the Alpine transit question became ever more urgent.

[ak]The tunnel's horizontal alignment was out by only about 30 centimetres and by 5 centimetres on the vertical. In engineering and surveying terms, it was nothing short of a miracle for the time. They had built the world's longest railway tunnel (15 kilometres). The Gotthard Tunnel's grand opening in 1882 made headlines around the world as a great feat of engineering by the small Alpine nation.

[al]The cost was CHF 227M and it took approximately 18.4 million man-days to build it, with an average of 5472 workers on site.

[am]It was widely known that many scores of workers suffered accidents while building the first Gotthard tunnel from 1872. The casualty list stated 171 fatalities, but many were injured and simply sent home without any aftercare.

[an]You sure this is supposed to be Hamburg? 


Looks more like Frankfurt or Stuttgart on the map. Also, Hamburg doesn't make a lot of sense since it's on the north sea way up in the north of germany. 


Hamburg > Milan still takes you more than a day I reckon. 


I'd go for Munich or Stuttgart as starting points for this.
[ao]The tunnel is mostly financed by foreign capital and is a great commercial success. The results in its first year of operation vastly exceed expectations, with six times as many passengers and twice the volume of freight originally forecast.

[ap]We do have a Public Transportation Article in our Constitution (Art. 81a) but it was added in 2014 via public vote which was fairly uncontroversial and IMO considered a formality.


Just keep that in mind when you're framing this fact since saying we always had a constitutional right to PT (historically) would be wrong.

[ar]Mattstetten–Rothrist high-speed cutoff between Olten and Bern (Bahn-2000), which chopped Zürich–Bern from 69 → 56 min, Basel–Bern 67 → 55, Olten–Bern 40 → 26—precisely to make :00/:30 nodes work in Bern/Zürich/Basel. That required major new line works… and yes, drilling/boring and big earthworks
